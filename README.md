# Simple To-Do List Web App

This repository contains the code for a clean and simple To-Do List web application. The project was built to practice and demonstrate fundamental skills in front-end web development, including DOM manipulation with JavaScript, user event handling, and modern HTML5/CSS3 styling.

The application allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete, with all data being stored locally in the browser.

### âœ¨ Key Features

* **Add Tasks:** Users can quickly add new tasks to their list via an input field.
* **Delete Tasks:** Individual tasks can be removed from the list.
* **Mark as Complete:** Users can toggle the completion status of a task, which is visually indicated with a strikethrough.
* **Simple & Responsive:** A clean, minimalist interface that works on different screen sizes.

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
